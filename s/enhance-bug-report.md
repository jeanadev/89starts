# Isolate a bug

A bug ticket is not a static document.

"I recreated this on Ubuntu with the 1.6 release per the ticket.
On Mac OS X, it also failed, but with a different error message and
with a stack trace."

(And give the message and contents of the stack trace!)

"I was not able to recreate this under Firefox 11.0, but it does happen on Firefox 9.1 and Safari 2.4."
If you have a theory, provide it.

"I remember reading that Firefox 11 was more forgiving in handling JavaScript that does X."

Be careful you are clear what is theory and guessing, and what is fact you’ve proven.
Avoid sweeping guesses.
Bad: “This happens with every template.”
Good: “I tried this on these seven templates: A, B, C, M, N, P and X”.
