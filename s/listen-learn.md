# Listen and learn

Every project has its own way of working.  There will be many
similarities between projects, but no two are the same.

* How does project work flow?  How are patches created and accepted?
* Who are the leaders?  Is there a single leader (benevolent dictator) or more of a committee?
* Whatâ€™s being worked on?
* What does the project value?
