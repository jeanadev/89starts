# Stitches

Stitches are what make up the fabric of open source communities and projects.

On any project, or in any community, many small actions work together
to create a greater whole.  For example, a Wikipedia page is made
up of hundreds or thousands of edits, mostly made by different
people.  The first version of [the Wikipedia page for Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa)
was just one sentence and a list of African countries.  It wasn't
one person that wrote everything about Africa, but dozens or hundreds
of contributors, each making a stitch.

Open source software projects are the same.  A single person or
small core team may work to start the project, but over time the
contributions of many form a whole that is better than the original
author(s) could have done alone.

The metaphor of a "stitch" also reminds us that we don't have to
understand the entire work to make a contribution, just as someone
working on a quilt can focus only one part of the entire piece.
