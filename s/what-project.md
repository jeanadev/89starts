# What project should I start with?

The best open source project to contribute to is one that you already use.

The second best is one that you're interested in using.

Open source is about scratching your itch. There's no point in
getting your open source start on a project that you wouldn't
actually use. You'll also not spend time and attention learning
about a project that's new to you. Better to jump in on a project
where you can start right away without all the startup time of
learning about it.

Projects that you use are also more likely to be established.
Searching through listings of projects at [GitHub][GitHub] or
 [SourceForge][SourceForge] will just have you sifting through
orphaned projects of dubious value.

It's possible that there is an open source drafting package out
there that could use some documentation, but if you don't know
anything about drafting or drawing, then you're probably not going
to be very useful.
